# There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

# It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# This is the first kata in series:

# Find the unique number (this kata)
# Find the unique string
# Find The Unique
